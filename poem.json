"Take this kiss upon the brow!\nAnd, in parting from you now,\nThus much let me avow--\nYou are not wrong, who deem\nThat my days have been a dream:\nYet if hope has flown away\nIn a night, or in a day,\nIn a vision or in none,\nIs it therefore the less _gone_?\n_All_ that we see or seem\nIs but a dream within a dream.\n\nI stand amid the roar\nOf a surf-tormented shore,\nAnd I hold within my hand\nGrains of the golden sand--\nHow few! yet how they creep\nThrough my fingers to the deep\nWhile I weep--while I weep!\nO God! can I not grasp\nThem with a tighter clasp?\nO God! can I not save\n_One_ from the pitiless wave?\nIs _all_ that we see or seem\nBut a dream within a dream?"
