"On a sunny brae, alone I lay\nOne summer afternoon;\nIt was the marriage-time of May\nWith her young lover, June.\n\nFrom her mother's heart, seemed loath to part\nThat queen of bridal charms,\nBut her father smiled on the fairest child\nHe ever held in his arms.\n\nThe trees did wave their plumy crests,\nThe glad birds caroled clear;\nAnd I, of all the wedding guests,\nWas only sullen there!\n\nThere was not one, but wished to shun\nMy aspect void of cheer;\nThe very grey rocks, looking on,\nAsked, \"What do you here?\"\n\nAnd I could utter no reply;\nIn sooth, I did not know\nWhy I had brought a clouded eye\nTo greet the general glow.\n\nSo, resting on a heathy bank,\nI took my heart to me;\nAnd we together sadly sank\nInto a reverie.\n\nWe thought, \"When winter comes again,\nWhere will these bright things be?\nAll vanished, like a vision vain,\nAn unreal mockery!\n\nThe birds that now so blithely sing,\nThrough deserts, frozen dry,\nPoor spectres of the perished spring,\nIn famished troops, will fly.\n\nAnd why should we be glad at all?\nThe leaf is hardly green,\nBefore a token of its fall\nIs on the surface seen!\"\n\nNow, whether it were really so,\nI never could be sure;\nBut as in fit of peevish woe,\nI stretched me on the moor.\n\nA thousand thousand gleaming fires\nSeemed kindling in the air;\nA thousand thousand silvery lyres\nResounded far and near:\n\nMethought, the very breath I breathed\nWas full of sparks divine,\nAnd all my heather-couch was wreathed\nBy that celestial shine!\n\nAnd, while the wide earth echoing rung\nTo their strange minstrelsy,\nThe little glittering spirits sung,\nOr seemed to sing, to me.\n\n\"O mortal! mortal! let them die;\nLet time and tears destroy,\nThat we may overflow the sky\nWith universal joy!\n\nLet grief distract the sufferer's breast,\nAnd night obscure his way;\nThey hasten him to endless rest,\nAnd everlasting day.\n\nTo thee the world is like a tomb,\nA desert's naked shore;\nTo us, in unimagined bloom,\nIt brightens more and more!\n\nAnd could we lift the veil, and give\nOne brief glimpse to thine eye,\nThou wouldst rejoice for those that live,\nBecause they live to die.\"\n\nThe music ceased; the noonday dream,\nLike dream of night, withdrew;\nBut Fancy, still, will sometimes deem\nHer fond creation true."
