"HE crawls to the cliff and plays on a brink\nWhere every eye but his own would shrink;\nNo music he hears but the billow\u2019s noise,\nAnd shells and weeds are his only toys.\nNo lullaby can the mother find\nTo sing him to rest like the moaning wind;\nAnd the louder it wails and the fiercer it sweeps,\nThe deeper he breathes and the sounder he sleeps.\n\nAnd now his wandering feet can reach\nThe rugged tracks of the desolate beach;\nCreeping about like a Triton imp,\nTo find the haunts of the crab and shrimp.\nHe clings, with none to guide or help,\nTo the furthest ridge of slippery kelp;\nAnd his bold heart glows while he stands and mocks\nThe seamew\u2019s cry on the jutting rocks.\n\nFew years have wan\u2019d\u2014and now he stands\nBareheaded on the shelving sands.\nA boat is moor\u2019d, but his young hands cope\nRight well with the twisted cable rope;\nHe frees the craft, she kisses the tide;\nThe boy has climb\u2019d her beaten side:\nShe drifts\u2014she floats\u2014he shouts with glee;\nHis soul hath claim\u2019d its right on the sea.\n\n\u2019T is vain to tell him the howling breath\nRides over the waters with wreck and death:\nHe \u2019ll say there \u2019s more of fear and pain\nOn the plague-ridden earth than the storm-lash\u2019d main.\n\u2019T would be as wise to spend thy power\nIn trying to lure the bee from the flower,\nThe lark from the sky, or the worm from the grave,\nAs in weaning the Sea-Child from the wave."
